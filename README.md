#  Manage data in SQLite in iOS using Swift

This is demonstration based upon Medium article, [Manage data in SQLite in iOS using Swift 4](https://medium.com/@imbilalhassan/saving-data-in-sqlite-db-in-ios-using-swift-4-76b743d3ce0e).

The initial commit is the code from the question with only minor stylistic changes:

* Organizing methods into extensions;
* Using access control to distinguish between public interface and private implementation;
* Contemporary spacing and brace conventions
